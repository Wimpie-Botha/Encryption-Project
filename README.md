# Encryption-Project
This program was created for a encryption project for NWU. This Python-based tool provides an interface for file encryption and decryption using two different methods: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and a custom method that uses a combination of XOR cipher and Caesar cipher. The user interface is implemented using the Tkinter library
